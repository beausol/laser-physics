 \chapter{Laser Beams and Resonators: One-Dimensional Models\label{chp:laser_resonators_1d}}

The approximate description of a laser electromagnetic field as a transverse plane-polarized wave with the complex amplitude function given by \eqn{e_field_1d_w} allows us to build simple dynamical models of resonant cavities that are commonly used to build laser oscillators.  In this chapter, we will ignore the transverse dimensions of mirrors and other optical components, and rely on the \emph{scattering matrix}\index{Scattering matrix} \cite{ref:haus1984wfo,ref:siegman1986l} to build models of common ``two-port'' linear optical systems\index{Two-port optical component}.

 \red{Expand on this paragraph to include the discussions of time/frequency properties and quasi-normal modes.}
